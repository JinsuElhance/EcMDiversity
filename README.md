# Final Visualizations
Saved versions of each final visualization are in the `figures` directory.

# Getting Started
This project was built in a Python environment and all analysis was done in Ipython Notebooks. In order to ensure environment compatibility with this project you'll need to do the following:

Open a terminal from the repository and run these commands.
#### Install IPython Kernel
`pip install ipykernel`

Creating a virtual environment ensures that you are running these notebooks in a Python environment which mirrors the one they were produced in. Sometimes packages can become incompatible as they update, this avoids that risk.
#### Create a virtual environment
`> python -m venv .env`

#### Activate the virtual environment
`> .env/Scripts/Activate`

#### Install required python packages
`> pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run Jupyter
This should automatically open your browser to a locally hosted Jupyter interface. 

`> jupyter notebook`

# Running the Notebooks


There are two notebooks, one for each section of the assignment. Once you have Jupyter up and running in the virtual environment you should be able to run these two notebooks top to bottom.
